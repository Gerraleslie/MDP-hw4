1. All the source code can be downloaded by this Git command:
git clone git@github.com:Gerraleslie/MDP-hw4.git

or you can find resources in this link:
https://github.com/Gerraleslie/MDP-hw4

2. There are two .ipynb files for two different MDP problems, FrozenLake_map.ipynb and ForestManagement.ipynb. 
Each one includes Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Q-Learning algorithm to run. 
The results of iterations/time to converge, rewards, error and policy map are obtained in these two code files.

3. There is a 'Others' folder, which contains several source code for some results of the experiment.
They includes the comparison of the mdp with different number of states, test for different learning rate of the Q-Learning and other supplement data, etc.
They are mainly for argument supplement of conclusion.

4. Some external libraries are needed:
- gym
- matplotlib
- hiive.mdptoolbox
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn

5. All the source code is required to run cells in order.
